Following the data cleaning and preprocessing, the exploratory analysis was carried out, which involved examining the variable's distribution, identifying patterns and relationships between variable's, and using visualizations to obtain insights into the Airbnb market in New York City. This process revealed some interesting findings, such as the most popular neighborhoods, the most common room types, the average price of listings in different neighbourhoods etc.\n",
